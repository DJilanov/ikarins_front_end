This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps };\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nvar MdIcon = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _mdIconRegistry\n     */\n    function MdIcon(_elementRef, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        /** Screenreader label for the icon. */\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MdIcon.prototype, \"color\", {\n        /**\n         * Color of the icon.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._color; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) { this._updateColor(value); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} newColor\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._updateColor = function (newColor) {\n        this._setElementColor(this._color, false);\n        this._setElementColor(newColor, true);\n        this._color = newColor;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} color\n     * @param {?} isAdd\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._setElementColor = function (color, isAdd) {\n        if (color != null && color != '') {\n            this._renderer.setElementClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"mat-\" + color, isAdd);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.

Doing so allows to specifiy at what\n * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\", offset: 0 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\", offset: 0.2 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\", offset: 0.3 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\", offset: 1 })\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets\n * will be calculated automatically.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\" }) // offset = 0\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\" }) // offset = 0.33\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\" }) // offset = 0.66\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\" }) // offset = 1\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction keyframes(steps) {\n    return { type: 5 /* KeyframeSequence */, steps: steps };\n}\n/**\n * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {\\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>\n * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting\n * and/or ending state).\n *\n * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this\n * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the\n * function is true then the associated animation will be run.\n *\n * Animation transitions are placed within an {\\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition\n * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation\n * states} is expected to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition\n * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be\n * triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n *\n *   // you can also go full out and include a function\n *   transition((fromState, toState) => {\n *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked\n *     return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *   }, animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a\n * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc\n * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps };\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

It can be used in the following ways:\n * - Specify the svgSrc input to load an SVG icon from a URL. The SVG content is directly inlined\n *   as a child of the <md-icon> component, so that CSS styles can easily be applied to it.\n *   The URL is loaded via an XMLHttpRequest, so it must be on the same domain as the page or its\n *   server must be configured to allow cross-domain requests.\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon svgSrc=\"assets/arrow.svg\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify the svgIcon input to load an SVG icon from a URL previously registered with the\n *   addSvgIcon, addSvgIconInNamespace, addSvgIconSet, or addSvgIconSetInNamespace methods of\n *   MdIconRegistry. If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nvar MdIcon = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _mdIconRegistry\n     */\n    function MdIcon(_elementRef, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        /** Screenreader label for the icon. */\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MdIcon.prototype, \"color\", {\n        /**\n         * Color of the icon.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._color; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) { this._updateColor(value); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} newColor\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._updateColor = function (newColor) {\n        this._setElementColor(this._color, false);\n        this._setElementColor(newColor, true);\n        this._color = newColor;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} color\n     * @param {?} isAdd\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._setElementColor = function (color, isAdd) {\n        if (color != null && color != '') {\n            this._renderer.setElementClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"mat-\" + color, isAdd);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.
